        <h2 id="1">Introduction into TIC</h2>
            <h3 id="1.1">Definition of TIC</h3>
            <p><b>Tic</b> Formally known as <b>Information and Communication Technologies</b>  is a broad term that encompasses <br>
              all technical tools needed to manage information and facilitate communication,such as computer and network hardware,<br>
              communication middleware,and essential software.and it is made up of two essential keywords:<br/>
                <ul>
                <li><b>Information:</b>data placed within a context. It is a message that the sender intends to communicate to the receiver.</li>
                <li><b>Communication:</b>It is the process of sending information, usually via a common system of symbols. <br>
                  Communication can be participatory, transactive, deliberate, or unintended; verbal or nonverbal.
                </ul>

            <h3 id="1.2">The Objective and Goal of Tic</h3>
             <p>The goal of Tic is to improve access to information and make human-to-human,human-to-machine, and machine-to-machine (M2M) <br>
               communication easier and more efficient. Which in turn makes the speed of project development faster and more efficient compared<br>
                to basic methods of communication.</p>
        <h2 id="2"> History and Economy of Tic</h2>
            <h3 id="2.1">The Development History of Tic</h3>
            <p>The concept of Tic can be traced back to the 19th century with the development of the telegraph and the telephone. These two <br>
              inventions revolutionized the way people worked and interacted socially by making it possible for one person to communicate with <br>
              another person in a different location in real or near-real time.<br></p>

              <p>In the middle of the 20th century, radio and television introduced the concept of mass communication, and by the end of the <br>
              century, the Internet had become a mainstream tool for communication.</p>

        <h2 id="3"> TIC As a subject in Education</h2>
                <p>Tic has also become integral to the teaching-learning interaction, through such approaches as replacing chalkboards with interactive<br>
                   digital whiteboards, using student’s own smartphones or other devices for learning during class time, and the “flipped classroom”
                   <br> model where students watch lectures at home on the computer and use classroom time for more interactive exercises.</p>

           <h3 id="3.1">In developed countries</h3> 
           <p>The Teaching of Tic in developed countries -most notably the USA- has been a great success since the 2000's and is only becoming <br>
             more developed with time which shows that with effective education plans and enough funding it is very possible to make Tic a school <br>
            subject for students lower than the level of university.</p>

            <h3 id="3.2">In 3rd world countries</h3> 
            <p>efforts to start implementing Tic in universities has been fairly successful, but it's Implementation is not without its challenges<br> 
            even though mobile phone and internet use are increasing much more rapidly in the third world, the progress is still slow but with <br>
             enough time and funding it will be able to reach the level of success that developed countries reached.
